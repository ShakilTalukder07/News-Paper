                <p>Var
                    Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables
                    declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to
                    emerge.
                    First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.

                    Scope of var
                    Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are
                    globally
                    scoped or function/locally scoped.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>Let
                    let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to
                    var
                    declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this
                    is
                    so.

                    let is block scoped
                    A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly
                    braces is a block.

                    So a variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within that block. </p>
                
                <br>
                <p>Const
                    Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some
                    similarities with let declarations.

                    const declarations are block scoped
                    Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were
                    declared.

                    const cannot be updated or re-declared
                    This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope.
                    It
                    cannot be updated or re-declared.</p>

                to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.</p>

              <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in
                older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain
                dynamic elements.</p>
